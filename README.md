# daikinone2influx
daikin one to influx


Much thanks to https://github.com/apetrycki/daikinskyport
especially https://github.com/apetrycki/daikinskyport/blob/master/API_info.md

some abreviations:
ct = current value?
ht = heating temperature
sp = set point
csp = cooling set point
hsp = heating set point
sched = schedule
hum = humidity/humidifier
AH - Air Handler
IFC = Indoor Furnace

couldn't get the integrator api (https://www.daikinone.com/openapi/overview/index.html) to work, so stuck with this.
